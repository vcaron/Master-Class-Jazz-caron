						<p>"We had unforgettable moments!"<br><br>

							This is what emerges from this unique event in Europe.
							All the participants were satisfied ... <br>
							Some cried leaving us .. (Sacred <! - content ->
							M.) <br>
							They played, ate, laughed, learned and shared intense moments with these great Jazzmen of extraordinary kindness and humility.
							+ PRIVATE CONCERTS OF THE MASTERS AND JAM EVERY EVENING IN THE AUDITORIUM !! <br> <br>

							Everything has been done so that the logistics and hosting of this Master is at the top. <br> <br>
							Each study room is equipped with the rider requested by the Artist.
							For Mike STERN a musician translator assists the Master.

							The Battery Room is equipped with 3 batteries.
							                            The Bass and Guitar Rooms have amps for all students.
							Sidemen are planned to accompany the Masters. <br>
							This configuration makes it possible to work in small groups of studies as well as lectures. <br> <br>

							The program and course of each course is left to the discretion of each Master.
							THE LEVELS <br>
							No special level is required to participate in this unique Masterclass ... <br> <br>

							Apart from that of a novice, of course, and that is understandable. <br>
							Sorry for some budding musicians who contacted us ... <br> <br>

							On the other hand all enlightened amateurs, semi professionals or - like some of our participants - pros are welcome! <br>
							ALL LEVELS ARE PRESENT ... <br> <br>

							Our teachers are excellent pedagogues, and will do their own workshops to play with the musicians present according to their knowledge ... <br> <br>

							IMPORTANT: In front of the request, we insist on the fact that a masterclass is made to LEARN!
							Do not think you have to be at the level of these immense musicians to register! ... <br>
							(Personally, as a guitarist and organizer, if I was Mike Stern's level, I'd rather play with him in concert! ;-))
							WHAT INCLUDES THIS MASTERCLASS? <br> <br>

						<Ul> <il> 20 Hours of classes. </ Il>
							<Il> Translating musicians for Mike Stern. </ Il>
							<Il> The material to play in workshop such as amps, pianos, batteries. </ Il>
							<Il> Gourmet breaks and refreshments during the sessions. </ Il> </ ul>
